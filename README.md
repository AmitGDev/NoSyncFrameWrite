**Overview**

This repository demonstrates a concurrent frame buffer update technique implemented in C++23. It utilizes multiple threads to efficiently modify a large frame buffer without the need for synchronization primitives like mutexes. This can potentially improve performance in applications dealing with real-time graphics, animations, or simulations.

**Note:** This is a demonstration and not intended as a production-ready library.

**Features**

- Concurrent Updates:
  - Modifies frame buffers concurrently using multiple threads, showcasing potential performance improvements.
  - No synchronization primitives used, demonstrating the approach.
- Large Buffer Handling:
  - Designed to handle large frame buffers commonly used in graphics and simulation applications.
- Simple Usage:
  - Provides a basic demonstration of how to use concurrent updates.
- Testing:
  - Includes tests to verify functionality and performance vs thread countIncludes tests to verify functionality and performance against various thread counts.
